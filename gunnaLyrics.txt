Got a check in a checkerboard case
Park the foreigns in back of the gate
Pop my shit and I'ma pop at your face
Got on all of my ice, I'ma skate
We go 
And its the price you gon' pay
We get geeked up like back in the day
Bitch come fuck the circle an get paid
You can't get close to the safe
50 racks on a AP today
I smoke on that shit from L.A
Stack that shit up and stay out the way stay out the way
I popped a bean and I gave my bitch a xanny
I pour up clean out the pint and I don't measure
I up that thing on your click, might cause a hazard
I'm from the old school cut, let's put on 
Remember highschool, nigga I was dripping in belly
Now we on private jets, I turned my residence to Cali'
In the YSL family, first we established
Pocket filled with green, nigga that cabbage
I need D my size
With this drip, bitch better catch me outside
I only want Forgiato rims when I ride
And a fully loaded FN on my side
I know my bro won't lose his hope 'fore I free him out the chain gang
I run with locs, they can get it for the low, these young niggas gang bang
All a real street nigga wanna do is stack it up and maintain
Then jump out 'Rari on these bitches, letting these chains swang
Got some VVS's these ain't VS1
Brand new Balmain boots, nigga don't get stepped on
Got yo main bitch with me holding my left arm
And they wanted me to stop, muhfucker I kept going
Bitch thought she was my girl, had to pass her like Brett Favre
On a brand new G5 taking off like NASA
Wild lil' beast better move on the street like a jaguar
And she'll stress 'till I eat that fish like Alaska
I popped a bean and I gave my bitch a xanny
I pour up clean out the pint and I don't measure
I up that thing on your click, might cause a hazard
I'm from the old school cut, let's put on 
Remember highschool, nigga I was dripping in belly
Now we on private jets, I turned my residence to Cali'
In the YSL family, first we established
Pocket filled with green, nigga that cabbage
I can't tell no lies
On the private island where we reside
I don't need no stylist with the shit I buy
I put that shit on 
I feel like Al Capone, play with me you die
She could type, connect this shit to the ties
New wristwatch, iced my shit 'fore I strive
It came with all lies
Protect my pride
I popped a bean and I gave my bitch a xanny
I pour up clean out the pint and I don't measure
I up that thing on your click, might cause a hazard
I'm from the old school cut, let's put on 
Remember highschool, nigga I was dripping in belly
Now we on private jets, I turned my residence to Cali'
In the YSL family, first we established
Pocket filled with green, nigga that cabbage
Told you we was gon' be rich
And stack my chips
So much money don't make no sense
I don't know what I spent
Make me wanna cop that Benz
Ride around the town with no tint
Cash in the bag we lit
Smashed and then got in that 'Vette
So much money don't make no sense
I ain't got no friends
Tom Ford all over my lens
Got racks in my pants
Ride with a FN
Got steel like Pakistan
I flew 'cross the map again
Got shows and I got fans
Gotta count them racks again
I ain't hide my safe in the attic
Smoke weed, sip lean, eat molly, pop xan bitch
Please don't panic
Got a Glock 19 black matte
Gotta ride with that static
Lil Duke with a iced out Patek
YSL getting green like salad
Gunna got a flow, can't get it
Fucking on all these bitches
My diamonds wash all the dishes
You niggas can't reinvent me
Pull up in that foreign, foreign, foreign at the Weston
Fucking on a pedestrian
I got these bitches desperate
Told you we was gon' be rich
And stack my chips
So much money don't make no sense
I don't know what I spent
Make me wanna cop that Benz
Ride around the town with no tint
Cash in the bag we lit
Smashed and then got in that 'Vette
So much money don't make no sense
I ain't got no friends
Tom Ford all over my lens
Got racks in my pants
Ride with a FN
Got steel like Pakistan
I flew 'cross the map again
Got shows and I got fans
Gotta count them racks again
Told you lil' niggas that we gon' be rich
Run that shit up so much, don't make no sense
Used to ride  now pull up in Benz
Sipping on lean 'bout to fuck up my kidneys
Since a young nigga, been getting it
Quick to turn 10 to a 20
All of these bad bitches they on my dick, I got plenty
Selling out shows and winning
This foreign on me got tint
Riding with a bad lil' bitch
Hop on the highway, she suck on my dick
Diamonds on me and they looking like piss
Mama I told you that we gon' be rich
Gotta keep it real and can't ever switch
I had to stack up my chips
Stuck in the streets, came up off a lick
I had to stay down, stay in my own lane
Mama she told me, "don't go against the grain"
Knew what I been through, you can't feel my pain
Keep it so real that shit run through my vein
Made myself a boss and made me a name
Work in the trap, make the trap go insane
And ain't a damn thing changed, ah
Told you we was gon' be rich
And stack my chips
So much money don't make no sense
I don't know what I spent
Make me wanna cop that Benz
Ride around the town with no tint
Cash in the bag we lit
Smashed and then got in that 'Vette
So much money don't make no sense
I ain't got no friends
Tom Ford all over my lens
Got racks in my pants
Ride with a FN
Got steel like Pakistan
I flew 'cross the map again
Got shows and I got fans
Gotta count them racks again
